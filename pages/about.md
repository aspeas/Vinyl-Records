## About the Collection

"This site hosts a digitized collection of various vinyl records from the Speas and Moore families. These records come from four different generations of two families. I, Allie Speas, am the fourth-generation in this collection. Most of my albums were either purchased by myself, bought new or thrifted, or gifted to me from dear friends and family. The third-generation is my dad, Jim Speas, and he influenced my music taste quite a bit as a child. The second-generation is my grandfather, Riki Moore, who actually gave me his record collection as well as his parents’ collection. This leaves us with the first-generation being Eva Moore.

I got my first record player as a junior in high school. My parents found it at a garage sale and brought it back home to me as a surprise. I had always wanted one and receiving this record player (insert photo) was a beloved gift. It has followed me from switching rooms in my house to traveling three hours away for my undergraduate education., and the wonderful tank still works like a charm

Getting a record playing jumpstarted my need to collect and purchase various vinyl records, despite how much my bank account cries because of it. It is also how I came into possession of my grandfather's and his mom’s collections. My grandfather gave me all of them for Christmas the year that I got the record player.

Some of my personal vinyls are Billy Joel’s The Stranger, which I found in a thrift store near my undergrad, and Sleeping at Last’s Atlas: Space. My music taste is quite broad and as a result most of the genres that are represented by my thirteen records are all over the place. However, other generations are more specific to one or two genres.

I am extremely grateful to all of my friends and family who have gifted records to me. I am also grateful to these people as each person has shaped me and my music taste in some fashion."
